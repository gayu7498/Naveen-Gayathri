                                <p>It was the most beautiful day when we found out we were expecting. In the early morning, I checked the kit. It initially
                                showed just one line, and I told him it didn’t come. But after a few minutes, the second line appeared. He noticed, took
                                a picture, and sent it to my phone. When I saw it, I was overwhelmed with joy. We shared the news with our family, and
                                everyone was thrilled.</p>

                                    <p>We went together for our first baby scan, a moment I had been waiting for with excitement. Hearing our baby’s heartbeat
                                    for the first time was such a special and emotional experience for me — something I’ll never forget. Sadly, he wasn’t
                                    allowed inside and couldn’t hear it, but I shared every little detail with him the moment I stepped out. Even though he
                                    missed the sound, we both felt the joy deeply in our hearts.</p>

                        <p>We celebrated our first Pongal together — our Thala Pongal — in a traditional way. We cooked sweet Pongal in a manpaanai

                        <p>Right after our Pongal celebration, I caught a cold and had to be admitted to the hospital for observation. After a few
                        tests, I was advised to undergo a blood transfusion. It was a tough phase, but he stood by me every moment. Along with
                        my mother, he took care of me patiently — bringing home-cooked food every morning, staying by my side, and making sure I
                        felt comforted and cared for. His quiet support meant the world to me during those days.</p>
